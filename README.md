Peptide drugs make up a growing proportion of the pharmaceutical market. However, computational prediction of peptide-protein binding affinity remains difficult, which limits the use of computational methods to assist the optimization of bioactive peptides. We have developed a novel method for modelling peptide unbinding, designated contact parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (cPaCS-MD), which, when combined with Markov state models, accurately predict peptide binding affinities. We applied cPaCS-MD to a diverse set of twelve protein-peptide complexes and found that it predicts experimental peptide binding free energy, with a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84) and high accuracy (mean absolute error of 2.7 kJ/mol and root mean squared Error and 3.4 kJ/mol). We compared cPaCS-MD to the widely used steered molecular dynamics-umbrella sampling (SMD-US) method and found that PaCS-MD is more computationally efficient and of much greater accuracy. This work is the first benchmarking study of MD methods for predicting peptide binding affinities that uses a diverse set of peptide ligands.
